write a c++ program to implement a piecewise constant function using a class name pwflat
make sure operator() is left-continuous
include operator[] to access f coordinate points in the curve
call the x-coordinate t and the y-coordinate f
put it in a namespace called fsl
use the last point to extrapolate the function to the right
